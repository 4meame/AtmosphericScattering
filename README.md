Open source (FreeBSD) atmospheric scattering for Unity. 

! Early version. Very, very unoptimized. I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to use it yet. Pretty much everything is subject to change. I'll give more information as I progress. Light shafts currently aren't supported. It controls sky color, atmospheric fog, ambient light color and directional light color.

See the demo scene on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/MC6MKYHllX0)

### Usage
* Add AtmosphericSactteringRenderer script to your camera.
* Add AtmosphericScattering script to the main directional light.

See included sample scenes.
